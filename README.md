- **31-90 days**: Shows weeks + days (e.g., "10w 6d") 
- **>90 days**: Shows months + weeks + days (e.g., "10m 1w 3d")

## Dot Visualization

Each dot represents one time unit:
- ðŸŸ  Orange dots = 1 month each
- ðŸŸ£ Purple dots = 1 week each  
- ðŸ”µ Blue dots = 1 day each
- âšª Gray dots = Passed time units
